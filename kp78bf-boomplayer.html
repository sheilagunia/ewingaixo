                            <p> Hi all, Condensing the discussion mega thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/3wtyn3/rpoker_improvement_step_1_posting_guidelines/) here's a quick first pass summary for your feedback. (If you are unaware, this is part of an improvement project found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/3wcv1j/rpoker_proposal/) Speak with comments + upvote stuff you agree with and we can refine this. 1) All posts must be flaired. Any post not flaired will be automatically hidden until. I'm looking for hands that will make me think about what I would do in those spots. Not just crazy hands and bad beats. I know people do post boomplayer hands asking for advice but is there an archive of these type of hands? Thanks. Can we all only use those kinds of sites as a secondary source for hand analysis and use the actual Reddit format primarily? It's just easier for people using mobile phones and once you get used to the format it's quicker and easier to read then the flash based players. Just my opinion anyway. Upvote or downvote accordingly. It sucks tremendous cock to go through a boomplayer hand and on mobile it's completely unwatchable. It is a time waster and you could've used that time you took watching this shitty decision to play five hands and rake in that cheddar cheese. Boomplayer is one of those silly poker inventions in the same category as free rolls or Christmas challenges on stars. It's a unnecessary concept made for the fish to enjoy the game more. If you want to be a good player though realize that boomplayer equals. Anyone else having issues with boomplayer? I hit share to boomplayer and nothing happens. It's not like it opens and doesn't play the hand, just nothing happens when i hit share. I can't get it to play hands. I had two fun hands that I wanted to upload, but all I see is a non-playing black square. Anyone else able to play hands or is it a site problem at the moment? here ( and here (http://www.boomplayer.com/en/poker-hands/Boom/4351244_46A5283EE7). 
There are a lot of discussions about individual hands in this sub, and I wonder if a web app for that would be useful. I imagine an app that accepts hand histories from various online poker sites (or allows manual entry), and gives a nice visual way to go through the hand, including annotations, so that you can talk about the decisions you made. Would you use such a thing. There is around 25 players left at this point and we are all in the money. http://www.boomplayer.com/en/poker-hands/Boom/7605466_FB74578BDC. Would appreciate any feedback on this hand. Was unsure if I should call the shove on the flop or not. https://www.boomplayer.com/30793524\_8ECC5F8F9F (https://www.boomplayer.com/30793524_8ECC5F8F9F). 
So I'm still a beginner at the game and would appreciate any advice or tips regarding the following hand: https://www.boomplayer.com/29766210\_65A4B12FB5 (https://www.boomplayer.com/29766210_65A4B12FB5) Was it a bad play from my part or is it just a bad beat? Thanks. https://www.boomplayer.com/30074535\_A15260679D (https://www.boomplayer.com/30074535_A15260679D) 5NLz. I'm in HJ with 76sh raise to 2.4 BB (standard), BTN calls, BB (Villain) calls. Pot 0.42. Relevant stacks are: me is full buy-in 5.00. BB with 2.20 (kinda fishy). Flop is 7c 8c 6d Villain from BB now leads into me with a bet of 0.10, I raise to 0.43, BTN folds, BB calls. Turn is a blank 2h. Now Villian makes the same bet of 0.10 into 1.25 pot. I raise to 0.55, he calls. Pot 2.30. River. Hey /r/poker I am a returning player who have not played for a few years, trying to get back to being less of a garbage player.

Preflop: UTG Raises big (8BB) and gets raised by the cutoff player (26.5BB). Hero calls, initial raiser calls. At this point the UTG player has a pretty great range, however the UTG raiser https://www.boomplayer.com/30386520_5E568E3884 Took break for long time and grinding the micros to build up a bankroll. Think this is my second royal i've ever hit. Just wanted to post it for shits and giggles. Loving this subreddit too! Used to lurk on 2+2 and it was toxic https://www.boomplayer.com/30110333\_6AD08842B0 (https://www.boomplayer.com/30110333_6AD08842B0) 10NLz. I am in BB with K5sh and defend from BTN raise of 0.30 (standard). I cover Villain (V), 8.00 effective. Flop AK5 all clubs. I check, BTN bets 0.40 into 0.62. All standard I think so far, but now: I check raise to 1.17 and V calls. TBH, I don’t know what I was thinking. Now that I started, raise is too small to fold out any Ax. Ax with a decent club is never folding. https://www.boomplayer.com/30135467\_76AF144CA1 (https://www.boomplayer.com/30135467_76AF144CA1) Really nice hand :D I know I know the line isn't the best , put it's 2NL and I had villans noted as crazy. Here is boom Replay (https://www.boomplayer.com/29997412_6363D6B26D?fbclid=IwAR19QQVOT49CZNMZFlVVasUaBpCjLUGp8aHSOMemZxhSIH4r8KNRVJeQGQY) I just want to ask if me turning poker off for a day after this one is justified because this is just bananas I don't want to be calling a bot without any backing, but this is just so out of the ordinary. https://www.boomplayer.com/29679877\_12FB418F6C (https://www.boomplayer.com/29679877_12FB418F6C).
