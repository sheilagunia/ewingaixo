It is a lost art of the Aldmer and something of a sore subject amongst the Altmer, for they feel their society should be capable of replicating such feats. Yet, no matter how hard they try, they never seem capable of producing their own somato-fetishes. Obviously, the High Elves must not be as smart as they claim.

I crafted a steel mace, but it's invisible. I have no idea why. I do have a large mod list, and I'm sure that's the issue, but I figured I would ask for help here before I went through my mod list manually to try to resolve the issue. I've read a few posts on a few websites, installed some compatibility patches, but nothing has solved the issue.

Hello, I've almost completed my mod list and the work is nearly done, but some things remain. I've noticed some clipping and NPC duplication/clipping using the mod list I currently have(no bashed patch yet). I've got JK's Skyrim LITE and Director's cut(I've also got a patch). Basically I've noticed some trees in Riften(right of the keep entrance) are clipping, also some structures in Whiterun, as well as NPCs(the Argonian selling things by the road on the left side, Jeer-Tai I think Long time pc player here. Let me give you some background first. (I have put a TL;DR below) So, I have recently completed a playthrough with Legacy of the Dragonborn ( Falskaar ( The Forgotten City ( Mighty Magick ( Sofia ( and SkyComplete (http://www.nexusmods.c. 
Has anyone else suffered any balancing issues in regards to the "Giant Tundra Spider"'s found around Whiterun? Most everything else seems to balance fine with the Requiem SIC patch DLC2 esp but these giant spiders are complete push overs with their small followers being roughly 6x tougher.

My first character was a male Breton mage, lvl19, with "most vanilla" gameplay. Second character was a Nord spellsword, lvl38, with a couple of combat mods like Mighty Magick+Apocalypse spell package. Thought I was getting too overpowered and facerolling everything. so I decided to start another character. At first I was apprehensive--what if I find everything dull and boring? Well, I decided to install these mods:. Hey everyone, I'm having a weird issue. Skyrim is crashing to desktop immediately upon trying to save, but only if I load saves that are after my first time traveling to Solstheim. I have plenty of "autosaves" to troubleshoot with thanks to the Autosave manager mod; this issue only applies to any that I load which came after arriving on Solstheim. The CTD behavior occurs no matter how the save happens (vanilla autosave, mod autosave, manual save, or quicksave). I have tried turning troubleshoot. The following is a compilation of segments from the Ballad of Harald Hand-Free, a traditional Nordic poetic saga recounting the life and adventures of the Skyim's first High King. Painstaking efforts have been taken to recover pieces of this fragmented story for the sake of historical preservation, but it remains incomplete at the current time of compilation. -Forthyn Kredrvu, Dean of History of the Solitude Bards' College, 3E 402 Part the First - Of His Blood And Father. Penned by Sir Rivalen Mothril, Knight, East Empire Company. This chapter represents not only a continuation from part four, but also an interlude. It breaks the narrative thusly established by focusing the eye of the scholar of Oriental affairs away from the familiar. It is not an unintentional divide. In the Eastern Provinces, Skyrim has been the strong arm of the Third Empire and Cyrodiil has ever been recognized as its heart. On the other hand, although connection to the Empire is weaker. OK I know what you're thinking, and that's fine, but I'm a few hours in now and can honestly say that it truly seems to be as good of a result that I didn't even dare hope for. So I had to spread the news, at least one of you might get some more of your moneys worth out Skyrim, so without further dribble I'll get to the point. ~prerequisites~ - Boss ( - Any modder should know these, I'm not covering them in the submission. - Wrye Bash (http://skyrim.nexu. 
3e 265 Whilst traversing a great Ayleid ruin in their heartland of Cyrod, during my stay with the dominion in 2e 582, I found it curious that the ruins, not only well preserved, were well lit. Some of the lighting came, naturally, from the Ayleid welkynd stones in their carefully-wrought holders adorning the white stone walls, but, curiously, more common were the use of lit torches, recently lit and burning bright.

I didn't realize it did not have a patch for RND and therefore would not get the player character drunk. So I uninstalled the mod.
